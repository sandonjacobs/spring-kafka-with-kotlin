= Parking Garage System üè¢

[.lead]
A Spring Boot application demonstrating real-time parking garage management using Spring Kafka and Kotlin.

== Overview üéØ

[.lead]
This application simulates a parking garage system that tracks vehicle entries and exits in real-time using Kafka for event streaming.

*Real-time tracking of parking spaces*
*Event-driven architecture with Kafka*
*RESTful API for status queries*
|===

== Features ‚ú®

* Real-time parking space tracking
* Multiple parking zones with individual capacity
* Event-driven architecture using Kafka
* REST API for querying parking status
* Caching layer for quick status lookups
* Protocol Buffers for efficient message serialization
* **Live web dashboard with per-zone status, animated event flow, and real-time updates**

== Architecture üèóÔ∏è

The system is designed for real-time, event-driven updates:

- The **Event Generator** simulates vehicle entries and exits, sending events to Kafka.
- **Kafka Streams** processes these events and maintains the current occupancy state for each parking zone.
- The **Cache Service** keeps a fast, in-memory view of the latest zone statuses and recent events.
- The **REST API** exposes endpoints for querying zone status and recent events.
- The **Web UI** polls the API for live updates, displaying animated, real-time status for each zone.

This architecture enables low-latency, scalable, and highly interactive monitoring of parking activity.

== Requirements üìã

* Java 17 or higher
* Apache Kafka 3.x
* Gradle 8.5+
* Protocol Buffers compiler

== Getting Started üöÄ

=== Prerequisites

1. Install Java 17 or higher
2. Install and start Apache Kafka
3. Install Protocol Buffers compiler

=== Building the Project

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew build
----

=== Running the Application

1. Start Apache Kafka
2. Run the application:
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun
----

== Real-Time Web UI üñ•Ô∏è

The application includes a modern, real-time dashboard for visualizing parking zone status:

* **Live status cards** for each parking zone, showing:
  * Zone name/ID
  * Current status (Available/Occupied)
  * Number of available slots
  * Animated car icons for recent entry/exit events
  * Last updated timestamp
* **No page reloads:** Each card updates itself in real time using AJAX polling.
* **Smooth animations:** Car icons animate in/out as vehicles enter or exit zones.
* **Mobile-friendly, responsive layout**

To use the dashboard, run the app and visit: `http://localhost:8080/`

== API Endpoints üåê

* `GET /api/zones` - Get current status of all parking zones
* `GET /api/zones/{zoneId}` - Get current status for a single zone (for per-card polling)
* `GET /api/zones/events` - Get recent entry/exit events for all zones (for UI animation)

== Technology Stack üíª

* Kotlin 1.9.22
* Spring Boot 3.2.3
* Spring Kafka
* Protocol Buffers
* Gradle with Kotlin DSL
* Caffeine Cache

== Development üõ†Ô∏è
